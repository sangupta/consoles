consoles
========

Java-based implementations for various consoles (pure text, swing-emulated and rich-text) that implement a standard API and pave
way for building better command-line tools in Java.

Aim
---
* JLine based pure console that works from a command-line shell of an operating system
* Swing based UI console that mimicks the shell of an operating system
* Consistent API for all console implementations

**This library is in very nascent unstable stage and should NOT be used.**

Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, 
`consoles` will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
